# My First Project with GitHub
This is a simple project created as part of my learning experience in software engineering. I'm using GitHub to manage my code and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as my code editor.
# What I Learned
- ```How to initialize a repository```

- ```How to stage, commit, and push changes```

- ```How to edit and organize code using VS Code```

- ```How to write a README file```
